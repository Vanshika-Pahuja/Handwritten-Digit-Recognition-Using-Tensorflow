# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_using_tensorflow
In this PROJECT, handwritten digit recognition is being done for the identification and recognition of handwritten digits. Convolutional neural networks are used which are the deep learning algorithm for the processing of images and differentiation of handwritten images. Tensorflow is the main library used for developing and training DL Models
